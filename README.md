# Encryption-Decryption
A program that asks the user to input a message and encrypts it in a randomly generated ciphertext which follows a key whose value is equals to the length/2 of the input message. Then decrypts the text message using the brute force attack. At the end it outputs all the possible tries and the decrypted text as well as the encrypted text.
